Vector Field Code Questions
// This is new to me- why are you declaring ints and floats on the left and redeclaring on the right?

int fieldPosX		= (int)(pctx * (float)fieldWidth);
    int fieldPosY		= (int)(pcty * (float)fieldHeight);
	float fieldRadius	= (float)(radiusPct * fieldWidth);
	

//Still kinda confused as to what external and internal dimensions are

// also confused by the addOutwardCircle, addCounterClockwiseCircle, addVectorCircle -- I pressed
0 in mouse dragged but couldn't see any difference.  Also the algorithm I don't quite understand. 
running through a for loop of start x and y and end x and y, looking through each pixel and then I get 
lost.  Not sure what the distance is calculating...  Also not sure what strongness refers to
 for (int i = startx; i < endx; i++){
        for (int j = starty; j < endy; j++){
			
            int pos = j * fieldWidth + i;
            float distance = (float)sqrt((fieldPosX-i)*(fieldPosX-i) +
                                         (fieldPosY-j)*(fieldPosY-j));
            
			if (distance < 0.0001) distance = 0.0001;  // since we divide by distance, do some checking here, devide by 0 is BADDDD
			
			if (distance < fieldRadius){
				
				float pct = 1.0f - (distance / fieldRadius);
                float strongness = strength * pct;
                field[pos].x += vx * strongness;   
                field[pos].y += vy * strongness;




                
int colorIndex = (x * VF.fieldWidth + y) * 3;          
// vector field is not stored in RGB, it's stored with each pixel as a vector.  this looks wrong.
for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++){     // no need to do this for loop, we don't have 3 values per pixel in the vector field image, we have one vector per pixel
ofColor color;
 float angle = ??????????;     // angle =    atan2(myVector.y, myVector.x)  

// you need to calculate length of the vector
// then use that for the brightness.  

color = ofMap(angle[colorIndex + c], 0, 255, 0, VF.fieldWidth);    
// I think you ofColor blah = ofColor::fromHsb(   ofMap(angle, ?,?, 0,255), 255, ???);

? ? = range of angle (print it out,I think it's between -PI and PI
??? = ofMap with the length of the vector (you'll need to see what the values are like), ie ofMap(length, 0,5, 0,255);

ps you might want to start by just doing a for loop to go through the vector field and print out the angle and length of each pixel. 

each pixel of the vector field is a vector
a vector stores and x and y value (ie, it's the offset in x and y)
the angle of that vector is atan2(y,x)
the length of that vector is myVector.length()   (the longer way to write it is:  sqrt(x*x + y*y) http://www.purplemath.com/modules/distform.htm

fieldWidth  and fieldHeight are the internal dimensions of the vector field, so you have fieldWidth* fieldHeight "pixels" in your image.   (each pixel being a vector)
